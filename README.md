# Cross Validation
Building an Ensemble Machine Learning Model and evaluating it using Cross Validation. 

## Problem Statement
A few learners have implemented random forest classifier on this Iris data, but better accuracy can be achieved by using the cross-validation sampling technique.
In this analysis, we will generate the random forest using the cross-validation splitting technique.

## Steps Covered
1. Shuffling the splitting dataset rtandomly into k groups
2. Summarizing the skill of the model using model evaluation scores
